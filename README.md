# schoolfiles

A repository to hold all the programming activities in school.
Also so I can practice using github.


## Contents

* C++ Activities from the first semester of 11th grade
    * (i'm lazy, i'll update this someday)

* Java Activities
    * (dunno)

## Workflow

* Java
    1. .java files are created/edited through VS Code
    2. .java files are compiled and tested through BlueJ because it's easier
    3. VS Code commits and pushes the changes
    4. A webhook to a channel in our discord server sends a notification.
